# Ridge Regression Model

This repository contains an implementation of the **Ridge Regression** model in Python using `NumPy` and `scikit-learn`. Ridge Regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a linear regression technique that includes an L2 penalty term to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting. It is especially useful when dealing with multicollinearity or when the number of features is larger than the number of observations.

## Introduction

Ridge Regression is a regularization technique for linear regression that aims to address overfitting by adding a penalty to the magnitude of the coefficients. The objective function in Ridge Regression is:
\[
J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} \left( y_i - \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\theta} \right)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2
\]

Where:
- \( J(\theta) \) is the **cost function** (objective function) that we aim to minimize.
- \( m \) is the number of training samples.
- \( y_i \) is the actual target value for the \(i\)-th training example.
- \( \mathbf{x}_i \) is the feature vector for the \(i\)-th training example.
- \( \boldsymbol{\theta} \) is the vector of model parameters (coefficients).
- \( \mathbf{x}_i^T \boldsymbol{\theta} \) is the dot product of the feature vector and the parameter vector, which gives the predicted value for the \(i\)-th example.
- \( \lambda \) is the **regularization parameter** (penalty term).
- \( \theta_j \) is the individual parameters (coefficients) of the model.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For matrix operations and numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data handling and manipulation.
- `scikit-learn`: For splitting data and model evaluation (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the regression results and visualizations.


## Installation

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

git clone https://github.com/Pranavsingh431/ridge_regression_project.git
