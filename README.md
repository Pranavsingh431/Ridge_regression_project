Ridge Regression Model

Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of Ridge Regression, a linear regression model that adds a regularization term to the loss function to prevent overfitting. Ridge regression is particularly useful when dealing with multicollinearity, a common problem in statistical modeling where independent variables are highly correlated.

Implementation

The model is implemented using the scikit-learn library, a popular machine learning library for Python. Key steps involved in the implementation:

Data Preprocessing:

Loading and cleaning the dataset.
Handling missing values and outliers.
Feature scaling (e.g., normalization or standardization).
Model Training:

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Initializing the Ridge Regression model with appropriate hyperparameters (e.g., alpha).
Training the model on the training set.
Model Evaluation:

Making predictions on the testing set.
Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

How to Use

Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Pranavsingh431/ridge_regression_project.git
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Notebook:

Open model_exploration.ipynb in a Jupyter Notebook environment to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Make Predictions:

Use the trained model to make predictions on new data. Refer to the model_training.py script for details.
Additional Considerations

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different values of the regularization parameter (alpha) to find the optimal setting. Techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search can be used for this purpose.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model to a production environment using tools like Flask, Django, or MLflow.
