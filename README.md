# Ridge Regression Model

This repository contains an implementation of the **Ridge Regression** model in Python using `NumPy` and `scikit-learn`. Ridge Regression, also known as Tikhonov regularization, is a linear regression technique that includes an L2 penalty term to reduce model complexity and prevent overfitting. It is especially useful when dealing with multicollinearity or when the number of features is larger than the number of observations.

## Introduction

Ridge Regression is a regularization technique for linear regression that aims to address overfitting by adding a penalty to the magnitude of the coefficients. The objective function in Ridge Regression is:

\[
J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_i - \theta^T x_i)^2 + \lambda \sum_{j=1}^{n} \theta_j^2
\]

Where:
- \(y_i\) is the target variable.
- \(x_i\) are the input features.
- \(\theta\) are the model parameters.
- \(\lambda\) is the regularization strength (also called the penalty term).

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`: For matrix operations and numerical computations.
- `pandas`: For data handling and manipulation.
- `scikit-learn`: For splitting data and model evaluation (e.g., Mean Squared Error).
- `matplotlib`: For plotting the regression results and visualizations.

You can install the necessary dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
